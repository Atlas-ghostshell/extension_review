## Result

- *No unnecessary or malicious extensions found.*
- *Browser security posture is strong.*
- No performance issues observed during or after the review.

## Lessons Learned

- Even trusted browsers can become vulnerable if extensions are not reviewed regularly.
- Permissions matter—any extension that can “read and change all your data on websites” must be trusted.
- Unused extensions should be removed to reduce the attack surface.
- Always check publisher authenticity and user reviews before installing any extension.

#  Task 7 – Browser Extension Audit and Cleanup

This repository contains my work for *Task 7* of the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship, which focused on reviewing browser extensions and identifying potential security threats within the browser environment.

---

##  Objective

> Review all installed browser extensions, remove any suspicious or unused ones, and learn how extensions can impact browser and system security.

---

## Tool Used

- *Microsoft Edge* – Extension manager used to review all installed add-ons

---

## Files Included

- extensions_review.md – Full audit log of browser extensions, findings, and lessons learned
- screenshots/  Presnet in the extension_review.md

---

##  Summary of Review

- All installed extensions were legitimate, trustworthy, and actively in use.
- No suspicious or unnecessary extensions were found.
- No changes were made during the review process.

---

##  Key Takeaways

- *Browser extensions have deep access* to your activity and data—regular audits are essential.
- Always check:
  - Publisher reputation
  - Permissions requested
  - User reviews
- Remove what you don’t use.
- Be cautious with “free” tools—they often monetize your data.
